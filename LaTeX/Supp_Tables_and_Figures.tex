%Neo-W alleles can spread when loci under diploid selection are tightly linked to the ancestral sex determining locus ($r\approx0$). 
%In panels A and B, the $a$ allele is favoured in females ($w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$) and selection in males is overdominant ($w_{aa}^\male=w_{AA}^\male=0.75$).
%In panels C and D, selection in males and females is overdominant ($w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$, $w_{aa}^\male=0.5$, $w_{AA}^\male=0.7$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$).
%There is no haploid selection $t^\Hermaphrodite = \alpha^\Hermaphrodite_\Delta = 0$.
%These parameters are marked by daggers in Figure \ref{fig:regionplots}B and C, which show that neo-W invasion is expected for any $R$ ($\lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)},\lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$) when the $a$ allele is nearly fixed on the Y (black lines in this figure; not stable for $r>>0$). 
%Equilibria where the $A$ allele is more common among Y-bearing male gametes can also be stable and allow neo-W invasion for these parameters (blue lines). 
%The weak selection approximation holds when all recombination rates are large relative to selection (around 0 in panels A and C), in which case, in the absence of haploid selection, neo-W alleles should spread if and only if they are more tightly linked to the selected locus (positive invasion fitness if and only if the selected locus is in the grey region). 
%However, when linkage is tight (panels B and D and when the selected locus is near the SDRs in all panels), this weak selection prediction can break down.

%Following invasion by a neo-W allele, there can be a complete transition to a new sex-determination system, maintenance of polymorphism at both ancestral-XY and neo-ZW sex determining regions, or loss of the new sex-determining allele. 
%Here we plot the frequency of the neo-W allele among female gametes; as the neo-W reaches frequency $0.5$, polymorphism at the ancestral XY locus is lost with Y becoming fixed such that sex is determined only be the ZW allele carried by a female gamete. 
%Panels A, C and D show cases where a steady state is reached with the neo-W at a frequency below $0.5$, in which case ancestral-X and Y alleles also both segregate. 
%In all cases, we assume that the $a$ allele is initially more common than the $A$ allele on the Y (Y-$a$ is fixed when $r=0$). 
%When $r>0$ (panels B and D), Y-$A$ haplotypes created by recombination can become more common than Y-$a$ haplotypes as the neo-W spreads.
%In B, this leads to loss of the neo-W and the system goes to an equilibrium with X-$a$ and Y-$A$ haplotypes fixed (equilibrium $A'$), such that all females have the high fitness genotype $aa$ and all males are $Aa$. 
%For the parameters in B, neo-W alleles have negative invasion fitness when the Y-$A$ haplotype is ancestrally more common than Y-$a$ (see blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:positionOverdominance}A and  \ref{fig:positionOverdominance}B near the ancestral SDR). 
%In contrast, the neo-W is not lost in panel D as it is favoured near $r\approx0$ (see blue lines in Figure \ref{fig:positionOverdominance}C and  \ref{fig:positionOverdominance}D near the ancestral SDR). 
%Fitness parameters are the same as in Figure \ref{fig:positionOverdominance}; in panels A and B the $a$ allele is favoured in females ($w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$) while there is overdominance in males ($w_{aa}^\male=w_{AA}^\male=0.75$) and in panels C and D, there is overdominance in both sexes ($w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$, $w_{aa}^\male=0.5$, $w_{AA}^\male=0.7$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$).

%Panel A shows that the invasion fitness of a neo-W is positive where linkage is tight, even when $r<R$ (unshaded region).
%In panel B, we vary the recombination rate between the neo-W and the selected locus ($R$) for a fixed recombination rate between the ancestral-SDR and the selected locus ($r=0.005$).

%The diploid selection parameters used in this plot are the same as in Figure \ref{fig:SexAntagTighter}.

%Meiotic drive in males affects whether neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes spread when the ancestral-XY locus is tightly linked to a locus under selection ($r=0$). 
%We vary the fitness of male homozygotes relative to heterozygotes ($w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$) and only consider stable equilibria at which both \textbf{A} locus allele are maintained and the $a$ allele is initially fixed on the Y, region outlined. 
%In panels A-C, meiotic drive in males favours the $a$ allele ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male=-0.16$), creating male-biased sex ratios and generally increasing $\lambda_{WA}$ and $\lambda_{Wa}$. 
%By contrast, $\lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ tend to be reduced when meiotic drive in males favours the $A$ allele ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male=0.16$), panels D-F. 
%We consider three forms of selection in females: directional selection in favour of the $A$ allele (panels A and D, $w_{aa}^\female=0.85$, $w_{AA}^\female=1.05$), direction selection in favour of the $a$ allele (panels B and E, $w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$), and overdominance (panels C and F, $w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$).

%Compared to the meiotic drive parameters in Figure \ref{fig:regionMaleDrive}, the effect of these male gametic competition parameters on the sex ratio is smaller.
