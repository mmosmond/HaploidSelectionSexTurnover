\section*{Abstract}
Sex determination is remarkably dynamic; many taxa display shifts in the location of sex-determining loci or the evolution of entirely new sex-determining systems. 
Predominant theories for why we observe such transitions generally conclude that novel sex-determining systems are favoured by selection if they equalise the sex ratio or increase linkage with a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sexually-antagonistic locus . 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{locus that experiences different selection in males vs.\ females. 
}\DIFaddend We use population genetic models to extend these theories in two ways: 
(1) We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{explicitly consider selection on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{consider the dynamics of }\DIFaddend loci very tightly linked to the ancestral sex-determining loci, e.g., within the non-recombining region of the ancestral sex chromosomes. 
Variation at such loci can favour the spread of new sex-determining systems in which the heterogametic sex changes (XY to ZW or ZW to XY) and the new sex-determining region is less closely linked (or \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{even }\DIFaddend unlinked) to the locus under selection\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which is not predicted by previous theory. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. %DIF > , which is \textcolor{red}{not expected from previous theory}. 
}\DIFaddend (2) We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend consider selection upon haploid genotypes either during gametic competition (e.g., pollen \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/sperm }\DIFdelend competition) or meiosis (i.e., non-Mendelian segregation), which can cause the zygotic sex ratio to become biased. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We find that associations with haploid selected loci }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Haploid selection }\DIFaddend can drive transitions between sex-determining systems \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, without requiring sexually-antagonistic selection in diploids.Unexpectedly, with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{without requiring selection to act differently in diploid males vs.\ females. 
With }\DIFaddend haploid selection, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we find that }\DIFaddend transitions between male and female heterogamety can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend evolve where linkage with the sex-determining locus is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{weakened. 
Furthermore, sex ratio biases may }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{either strengthened or weakened. 
%DIF > Furthermore, we find that the selective strengths exerted by the sex-ratio and associations with selected alleles are often equivalent. 
Furthermore, we find that the selective forces to equalize the sex ratio are equally important to selective forces that generate skewed sex ratios when accounting for the spread of new sex chromosomes.
This allows sex-ratio biases to }\DIFaddend increase or decrease with the spread of new sex chromosomes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. 
Thus, we find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and implies }\DIFaddend that transitions between sex-determining systems cannot be simply predicted by selection to equalise the sex ratio. 
Overall, our models reveal that transitions between sex-determining systems, particularly transitions where the heterogametic sex changes, can be driven by loci in previously unpredicted genomic locations that experience selection during diploid and/or haploid phases.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These results predict conditions under which sex-determining systems are likely to be labile and draw novel connections with sex ratio evolution.

\section*{Author summary}
Systems of sex determination are strikingly diverse and labile in many clades. 
This poses the question: what drives transitions between sex-determining systems? 
Here, we use models to derive conditions under which new sex-determining systems spread. 
Prevailing views suggest that new sex-determining systems are favoured when they equalize the sex ratio and/or when they are more closely linked to genes that experience differential selection in males and females. 
Our models \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extend these theories to }\DIFdelend include selection upon haploid genotypes (meiotic drive or gametic competition), which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{causes sex ratio biases }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{biases the sex-ratio }\DIFaddend and occurs differently in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{males and females}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{male and female gametes}\DIFaddend . 
Surprisingly, we find \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that neither force (sex ratio selection nor associations with genes that have sex-specific effects) dominates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the two forces (selection to equalize the sex ratio and the benefits of hitchhiking with driven alleles that distort the sex ratio) will often be equally strong, and thus neither is sufficient to explain }\DIFaddend the spread of new sex-determining systems \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{alone. 
Even more unexpectedly, we find that , to spread, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in every case. 
We also find that }\DIFaddend new sex-determining alleles \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do not necessarily have to arise in closer linkage with genes that are differentially selected in males and females. 
Therefore, our models predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can spread despite being less closely linked to selected loci, driven by initially tight linkage or haploid selection. 
Our models therefore predict that }\DIFaddend loci in previously unexpected genomic locations and/or experiencing various types of selection (including haploid selection) can now be implicated as drivers of transitions between sex-determining systems.

\DIFdelend %DIF > TRANSITIONS ARE COMMON
Animals and angiosperms exhibit extremely diverse sex-determining systems (reviewed in~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Bull:1983vi,Charlesworth:2010it,Beukeboom:2014vb,Bachtrog:2014bx}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Bull:1983vi,Charlesworth:2010it,Beukeboom:2014vb,Bachtrog:2014bx, Pennell2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend ). 
Among species with genetic sex determination (GSD)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of diploid sexes}\DIFdelend , some taxa have heterogametic males (XY) and homogametic females (XX), including %non-monotreme? I think monotremes have XY but tonnes of translocations, giving: X1,X2...X6 Y1
mammals and most dioecious plants~\cite{Ming:2011iy}; whereas other taxa have homogametic males (ZZ) and heterogametic females (ZW), including Lepidoptera and birds. 
Within several taxa, the chromosome that harbours the master sex-determining locus changes. 
For example, transitions of the master sex-determining locus between chromosomes or the evolution of new master sex-determining loci where the heterogametic sex does not change (hereafter `cis-GSD transitions') have occurred in Salmonids~\cite{Li:2011fm,Yano:2012di}, Diptera~\cite{Vicoso:2015hf}, and \textit{Oryzias}~\cite{Myosho:2012fv}. 
%Presentation at evolution found neo sex chromosome in birds, doesn't seem to be published or bioRxiv yet (consider pers com.), title: A previously unknown neo-sex chromosome mediates plumage divergence and speciation in hybridizing birds Jason Sardell; Elizabeth Cooper; J. Albert C. Uy. I wonder if this is actually a fusion event though?
In addition, many clades exhibit transitions between male and female heterogamety (XY$\leftrightarrow$ZW, hereafter `trans-GSD transitions'), including snakes~\cite{Gamble2017}, lizards~\cite{Ezaz:2009tk}, eight of 26 teleost fish families~\cite{Mank:2006bt}, true fruit flies (Tephritids,~\cite{Vicoso:2015hf}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend , amphibians~\cite{Hillis:1990gu}, the angiosperm genus \textit{Silene}~\cite{Slancarova:2013dq}, the angiosperm family \textit{Salicaceae}~\cite{Pucholt2015,Pucholt2017} and Coleoptera and Hemiptera (plate 2~\cite{Beukeboom:2014vb}).
Indeed, in some cases, both male and female heterogametic sex-determining systems can be found in the same species, as reported in houseflies~\cite{Macdonald1978}, midges~\cite{Thompson1971}, frogs~\cite{Ogata:2007jm}, cichlid fish~\cite{Ser:2010iq}, tilapia~\cite{Lee2004}, sea bass~\cite{Vandeputte2007}, and lab-strains of Zebrafish~\cite{Liew2012,Wilson2014}.
In addition, multiple transitions have occurred between genetic and environmental sex-determining systems (GSD$\leftrightarrow$ESD), e.g., in reptiles and fishes~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

In sum, accumulating evidence indicates that transitions between }\DIFaddend sex-determining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{systems by selection involve fitness differences between sexes (e.g., sexually antagonistic selection) or sex ratio selection~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

van Doorn and Kirkpatrick~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

and Muralidhar and Veller~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Muralidhar2018} }%DIFAUXCMD
have shown that new sex-determining alleles can be favoured if they arise at loci in close linkage with a locus that experiences sexual antagonism. 
Tighter linkage allows a stronger favourable association to build up between a male-beneficial allele, and a neo-Y allele, for example. 
Such associations can favour cis-GSD transitions ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{vanDoorn:2007eu}}%DIFAUXCMD
, trans-GSD transitions~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{vanDoorn:2010hu}}%DIFAUXCMD
, and new partially-masculinizing or partially-feminizing alleles~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Muralidhar2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
However, any sexually-antagonistic loci that are more closely linked to the ancestral sex-determining locus will develop similar, favourable associations and are expected to hinder the spread of a new sex-determining system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{systems are common~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

%DIF > \citet{Bull:1977wt} shows that direct selection on new sex determination loci can allow them to spread and switch between male and female heterogamety. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It has }\DIFaddend been suggested that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend selection is a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{particularly }\DIFaddend dominant force in the evolution of sex determination \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because the sex ratio is directly determined by the sex-determining system }\DIFaddend (e.g., Bull, 1983, p 66-67 ~\cite{Bull:1983vi}; Buekeboom and Perrin, 2014, Chapter 7~\cite{Beukeboom:2014vb}). 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Classic }\DIFaddend `Fisherian' \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend selection favours a 1:1 zygotic sex ratio when assuming that males and females are equally costly to produce~\cite{Fisher:1930wy,Charnov:1982wg}. 
This follows from the fact that, for an autosomal locus, half of the genetic material is inherited from a male and half from a female~\cite{West:2009we}. 
Thus, if the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{population }\DIFdelend sex ratio is biased\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{towards one sex, the average per-individual contribution of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, an individual of the rarer sex will, on average, contribute more }\DIFaddend genetic material to the next generation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from the opposite sex is greater. 
Therefore, a mutant that increases }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
Selection therefore typically favours mutants that increase }\DIFaddend investment in the rarer sex\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will spread via the higher per-individual contributions made by that sex.
%DIF < The default mode of sex ratio selection is `Fisherian' sex ratio selection, which favours equal investment in male and female offspring \citep[i.e., a 1:1 zygotic sex ratio when assuming that males and females are equally costly to produce,][]{Fisher:1930wy,Charnov:1982wg}. 
%DIF < Given that the sex-determining system can directly affect the sex ratio, we might expect Fisherian sex ratio selection to influence the spread of new sex-determining systems.

%genetic system
We consider transitions between ancestral and novel sex-determining systems using a three-locus model, each locus having two alleles (Fig \ref{fig:model_outline}). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A full description of our model, including recursion equations, is given in }\nameref{app:recurs}\DIFadd{. 
}\DIFaddend Locus $\mathbf{X}$ is the ancestral sex-determining region, with alleles X and Y (or Z and W).
Locus $\mathbf{A}$ is a locus under selection, with alleles $A$ and $a$.
Locus $\mathbf{M}$ is a novel sex-determining region, at which the null allele ($M$) is initially fixed in the population such that sex of zygotes is determined by the genotype at the ancestral sex-determining region, $\mathbf{X}$; XX genotypes become females and XY become males (or ZW become females and ZZ become males). 
To evaluate the evolution of new sex-determining systems, we consider the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{invasion, fixation, maintenance, and/or loss }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{spread }\DIFaddend of a novel sex-determining allele ($m$) at the $\mathbf{M}$ locus. 
%We only do invasion analytically though (is this sentence still ok?)

With $k=0$, the $m$ allele is a masculinizer (a neo-Y allele) and with $k=1$ the $m$ allele is a feminizer (a neo-W allele). 
With intermediate $k$, we can interpret $m$ as an environmental sex-determination (ESD) allele, such that zygotes develop as females in a proportion ($k$) of the environments they experience. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The assumption that derived sex-determining loci are epistatically dominant is motivated by empirical systems in which multiple sex determining alleles segregate (i.e., X, Y, Z, and W alleles present), such as, cichlid fish~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The new sex-determining allele increases in frequency when rare when the largest eigenvalue is greater than one ($\lambda_m^{(XY)}>1$). 
%If the average change in frequency of the two haplotypes that carry the $m$ allele ($Am$ and $am$) is positive, invasion will always occur, i.e., if $(\Lambda_{mA} + \Lambda_{ma})/2 > 1$ then $\Lambda > 1$. 
%The leading eigenvalue is the largest solution of $f(\lambda_m^{(i)})=(\lambda_m^{(i)})^2+b\lambda_m^{(i)}+c=0$ and the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that it is positive, unique, and real.  
%Since $f(\Lambda_{mA}^{(i)})$ and $f(\Lambda_{ma}^{(i)})$ are of opposite signs, the leading eigenvalue must fall between these two quantities and is the larger of them when $R = 0$ (see \nameref{file:Mathematica}).  
If both haplotypic growth rates are greater than one ($\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}, \Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}>1$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend then the new sex-determining allele invades regardless \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend the rate of recombination between the new sex-determining locus and the selected locus ($R$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; }\DIFaddend see \nameref{app:inv_cond} for details\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .
Conversely, if both haplotypic growth rates are less than one ($\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}, \Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}<1$) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend then invasion can never occur.  
Finally, if only one haplotypic growth rate is greater than one, the new sex-determining allele can always invade when arising at a locus that is tightly linked to the selected locus ($R\approx0$).  
Furthermore, it can be shown that the leading eigenvalue declines with $R$, and invasion requires that $R$ is sufficiently small such that: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambdasGen}
%\frac{\chi_{mA}}{\Lambda_{mA}-1}+\frac{\chi_{ma}}{\Lambda_{ma}-1}>0.
\chi_{ma}^{(XY)}/\left(\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)} - 1\right) + \chi_{mA}^{(XY)}/\left(\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)} - 1\right) < 1.
\end{equation}
\noindent 
This condition may or may not be satisfied for the full range of locations of the new sex-determining locus, including $R=1/2$, depending on the nature of selection.  
Interpreting this condition, if we assume that only the $mA$ haplotype would increase in frequency when $R=0$ ($\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}<1<\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}$) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then }\DIFaddend the first term on the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:lambdasGen} is negative and invasion requires that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rate of growth of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{growth rate of }\DIFaddend $mA$ haplotypes ($\Lambda_{mA}^{(i)}-1>0$) and the rate at which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$mA$ haplotypes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they }\DIFaddend are produced by recombination \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in $ma$ haplotypes }\DIFdelend ($\chi_{ma}^{(i)}$) are sufficiently large relative to the rate of decline of $ma$ haplotypes ($1-\Lambda_{ma}^{(i)}>0$) and the rate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of loss of $mA$ haplotypes due to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at which $m$ and $A$ are dissociated by }\DIFaddend recombination ($\chi_{mA}^{(i)}$).

This is because\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in an ancestrally XY system, }\DIFaddend a gamete with the neo-Y always pairs with a female gamete containing an X \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend Fig \ref{fig:model_outline}C\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .

Consequently, neo-W-bearing females obtain a different frequency of $A$ alleles from mating (when $\hat{p}_X^\male \neq \hat{p}_Y^\male$) compared to ancestral ($MM$) females\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which can inhibit or favour its spread}\DIFaddend .

In order to explicitly determine the conditions under which a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rare }\DIFdelend new sex-determining allele spreads, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{must }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{next }\DIFaddend calculate the equilibrium frequency of the $A$ allele (i.e., $\hat{p}^\female_X$, $\hat{p}^\male_X$, and $\hat{p}^\male_Y$) and Y-bearing male gametes ($\hat{q}$) in the ancestral population. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Because }\DIFaddend only the $\mathbf{A}$ locus experiences selection directly, any deterministic evolution requires that there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be }\DIFaddend a polymorphism at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus.

\subsection*{\DIFadd{Tight linkage with the ancestral sex-determining locus ($r \approx 0$)}}

\DIFaddend When there is complete linkage between the ancestral sex-determining locus and the $\mathbf{A}$ locus ($r=0$), either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele must be fixed in gametes containing a Y allele. 
% because selection on the Y is effectively haploid an incapably of maintaining a polymorphism in the absence of frequency dependent selection. 
Because the labelling of alleles is arbitrary, we will assume that the $a$ locus is fixed in gametes with a Y ($p^\male_Y=0$), without loss of generality. 
If there are two alleles maintained at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus, the $A$ allele can be fixed ($\hat{p}^\female_X=\hat{p}^\male_X=1$) or segregating at an intermediate frequency (0<$\hat{p}^\female_X, \hat{p}^\male_X$<1) in gametes with an X. 
%However, because the X is present in both males and females, there are distinct selection pressures on X's in females and X's in males, which will always be paired with an $A$ allele from the Y.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When only one neo-W haplotype has growth rate greater than one (see Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}), a neo-W allele can invade as long as Eq \eqref{eq:lambdasGen} is satisfied, which may require that the recombination rate, $R$, is small enough.
Nevertheless, because we assume here that $r$ is small, these results indicate that a more loosely linked sex-determining region ($r<R$) can spread.
For example, tightly sex-linked loci that experience sexually-antagonistic selection can drive trans-GSD transitions in which the new sex-determining locus is less closely linked to the locus under selection (Fig \ref{fig:SexAntagTighter}). 

Given that the $a$ allele \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is fixed on the Y and }\DIFaddend can be considered ancestrally `male-beneficial'\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{because it is fixed on Y backgrounds}\DIFdelend , it is surprising that neo-W-$a$ haplotypes can sometimes be favoured by selection in females ($\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$). 
Again, this occurs because ancestral X alleles \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend experience selection in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{males, where they are ancestrally always paired with a Y-}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{both males and females, and conditions can arise where increases in the }\DIFaddend $a$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gamete. If }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allele would be favored in females too. %DIF > , where they are ancestrally always paired with a Y-$a$ gamete. 
For example, if }\DIFaddend there is overdominance in males, X-$A$ Y-$a$ males have high fitness and the $A$ allele is favoured by selection on the X background in males. 
Therefore, the $A$ allele can be polymorphic or even fixed on the X background despite selection favouring the $a$ allele in females (e.g., see outlined region in Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}B and~\cite{Lloyd1977,Otto2014}). 
In such cases, neo-W-$a$ haplotypes can spread because they create more $Aa$ and $aa$ females when pairing with an X-bearing gamete from males and because they bring Y-$a$ haplotypes into females, where it has higher fitness (Fig \ref{fig:model_outline}D). 

In some cases, both W-$A$ and W-$a$ haplotypes can spread.
For example, when $AA$ individuals have low fitness in females yet the $A$ is polymorphic or fixed on the X background due to overdominance in males (Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}B and \ref{fig:regionplots}C), both neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes produce fewer unfit $AA$ females.
This is true for the neo-W-$A$ haplotype because it can pair with a Y-$a$ haplotype and still be female. 
Wherever both haplotypic growth rates are greater than one, invasion by a neo-W is expected regardless of its linkage with the selected locus (i.e., for any $R$, see \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance} and \nameref{fig:temporalOverdominance} for examples). 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As a consequence, evolution can favor a new sex determination system on a different chromosome, despite the fact that this unlinks the sex-determining locus from the selected locus.
}\DIFaddend 

Assuming selection is weak relative to recombination, van Doorn and Kirkpatrick~\cite{vanDoorn:2010hu} showed that invasion by a neo-W allele occurs under the same conditions as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{`pseudo-fixation' (at pseudo-fixation the neo-W reaches its maximum frequency among eggs, which is usually 1/2, but can deviate from 1/2 when there is haploid selection before censusing).

}\DIFaddend An equivalent analysis is not possible where recombination rates are low. 
However, numerical simulations demonstrate that\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{new sex-determining }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, with tight sex linkage, neo-Y or neo-W }\DIFaddend alleles do not necessarily reach \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pseudo-fixation, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fixation in males or females, respectively, }\DIFaddend which can lead to the stable maintenance of a mixed sex-determining system, in which X, Y, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Z, and W }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and neo-W }\DIFaddend alleles all segregate (e.g., \nameref{fig:freqAll}B,C).

%The new sex-determining allele, $m$, will spread in an XY system if $\lambda_{m}^{(XY)}>1$. 
Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_neoY} demonstrates that, under weak selection, a neo-Y allele will invade an XY system ($\lambda_{Y'}^{(XY)}>1$) if and only if it is more closely linked to the selected locus than the ancestral sex-determining locus (i.e., if $R<r$; note that $V_{A}S_{A}^2$ is strictly positive as long as $\mathbf{A}$ is polymorphic). 
This echoes our results above where a neo-Y could never invade if $r\approx0$. 
It is also consistent with the results of \cite{vanDoorn:2007eu}, who considered diploid selection only and also found that cis-GSD transitions can only occur when the new sex-determining locus is more closely linked to a locus under sexually-antagonistic selection. 
%Because tighter linkage between the sex-determining region and a selected locus evolves during these transitions, stronger associations between selected alleles and diploid sexes can build up by selection (e.g., between male-beneficial alleles and the male-determining allele, Y).%, increasing diploid mean fitness (Fig \ref{fig:Combination_MeanFit}). 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{With weak selection and no }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When selection is weak relative to recombination, the absence of }\DIFaddend haploid selection (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t^\Hermaphrodite=\alpha^\Hermaphrodite_{\Delta}=0$), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t^\circ=\alpha^\circ_{\Delta}=0$), implies that }\DIFaddend the spread of a neo-W is equivalent to the spread of a neo-Y ($\lambda_{W'}^{(XY)}=\lambda_{Y'}^{(XY)}$), such that trans-GSD transitions can also occur only if the new sex-determining locus is more closely linked to a locus under selection ($R<r$), as found by \cite{vanDoorn:2010hu}. 
When there is haploid selection, invasion also typically occurs when the neo-W is more closely linked to the selected locus than the ancestral sex-determining region (Fig \ref{fig:Combination_Centimorgans}).
For example, if the $\mathbf{A}$ locus is unlinked to the ancestral sex-determining locus ($r=1/2$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which implies that $ \hat{p}^\male_Y-\hat{p}^\male_X =0$}\DIFaddend ), a more closely linked neo-W ($R<1/2$) can always invade.

%DIF > Conclusion 2B echoes the diploid-selection-only results of \cite{vanDoorn:2007eu,vanDoorn:2010hu}, but greatly extends the number of selective scenarios favouring transitions.

\DIFaddend %These transitions are unusual because, when $R>r$, associations that selection has built up between alleles more favourable in one sex and alleles that determine sex will be weakened. 
%Mean diploid fitness therefore decreases during heterogametic transitions that create looser sex-linkage (Fig \ref{fig:Combination_MeanFit}B,D). 
%Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_neoW} shows that, with weak selection, neo-W alleles can invade an XY system for a large number of selective regimes. 
%To clarify the parameter space under which $\lambda_{W'}^{(XY)}>1$ , we consider several special cases. 
%Firstly, if the $\mathbf{A}$ locus is unlinked to the ancestral sex-determining region ($r=1/2$), a more closely linked neo-W ($R<1/2$) can always invade because there is no ancestral association between $A$ alleles and sex chromosomes in males, $\left( \hat{p}^\male_Y-\hat{p}^\male_X \right)=0$, see Eq \eqref{eq:freq_diffs}. 
%The second term in Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_neoW} therefore disappears and invasion depends only on the sign of $(r-R)$, as in the case of the neo-Y. 
%Indeed, invasion typically occurs when the neo-W is more closely linked to the selected locus than the ancestral sex-determining region (Fig \ref{fig:Combination_Centimorgans}).

%
%Why can new sex-determining regions invade when they are more loosely linked to selected loci ($R>r$)?  
%Consider first the case where both sex-determining-loci are linked to the selected locus ($r<R<1/2$). 
%In an ancestral-XY system, haploid selection in males can facilitate the spread of a neo-W because the zygotic sex ratio is ancestrally male biased and the W produces more of the rarer sex (Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}A). 
%A new sex determining region can also, however, benefit from becoming more associated with drive. 
%For example in an ancestral-ZW system with the same selection regime (haploid selection in males), a neo-Y can spread despite the fact that the zygotic sex is initially even; in this case, the neo-Y spreads because it is often found in males and can, if it carries the driven allele $a$, benefit from haploid selection in males (Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}B). 

While equalizing the sex ratio and benefiting from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{drive }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{associations with selected alleles }\DIFaddend are two primary reasons why haploid selection spurs sex chromosome transitions, more complex situations also arise.  
For example with $R=1/2$ in Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}B (green curve), the neo-Y allele spreads despite the fact that it cannot benefit from drive because free recombination moves it randomly between driven and non-driven backgrounds.  
%DIF > Nevertheless, the unlinked neo-Y can spread because diploids bearing it more often carry the non-driven allele $A$, which is found at high frequency on the W background and has higher average diploid fitness.% to balance the haploid advantage of the $a$ allele at equilibrium.

\subsection*{Environmental sex determination}

We next consider the case where the new sex-determining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mutation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allele}\DIFaddend , $m$, causes sex to be determined probabilistically or by heterogeneous environmental conditions (environmental sex determination, ESD)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
In particular, we assume }\DIFaddend individuals carrying allele $m$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{developing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{develop }\DIFaddend as females with probability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$k$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$k\in(0,1)$}\DIFaddend .
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Here, we do not }\DIFdelend %DIF > \textcolor{red}{In our deterministic model this means the fraction female is exactly $k$, even when $m$ is rare (exploring the effect of the variance induced by ESD would also be interesting).}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In our deterministic model this means the fraction female in the subpopulation containing $m$ is exactly $k$, even when $m$ is rare (i.e., ESD does not introduce any additional variance in sex determination). 
We also }\DIFaddend assume that the environmental conditions that determine sex \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{do not }\DIFaddend differentially affect the fitness of males versus females. 
Such correlations can favour environmental sex-determining systems by allowing each sex to be produced in the environment in which it has highest fitness; in the absence of these correlations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend previous theory would predict that ESD is favoured when it produces more equal sex ratios than the ancestral system (see reviews by~\cite{Charnov:1982wg,Bull:1983vi,West:2009we}). %(e.g., maternal condition, mate quality, age, or host size)  

The characteristic polynomial determining the leading eigenvalue (equations \ref{eq:recursions}) does not factor for ESD ($0<k<1$) as it does for a neo-Y ($k=0$) or neo-W ($k=1$) allele. 
We therefore focus on weak selection here, where the leading eigenvalue is

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\lambda_{ESD'}^{(XY)} =& 1 + \frac{{(1-2k)}^2}{4}V_{A}{S_{A}}^2\frac{r-R}{r R} \\
&+\frac{k(\hat{p}^\male_Y-\hat{p}^\male_X)}{2}\left[ k \left(2\alpha_{\Delta}^\male-2\alpha_{\Delta}^\female+t^\male-t^\female \right) -2(1-k)S_{A}\right]+O\left(\epsilon^3\right).
\end{split}
\label{eq:lambda_ESD_k}
\end{equation}

\noindent
This reduces to $\lambda_{Y'}^{(XY)}$ when $k=0$ and $\lambda_{W'}^{(XY)}$ when $k=1$. 

%DIF < Under Fisherian sex ratio selection, autosomal modifiers favour equal investment in male and female offspring, i.e., a 1:1 sex ratio~\cite{Fisher:1930wy,Charnov:1982wg,West:2009we}.

The spread of such \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ESD }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mutations }\DIFaddend is determined by

where $\lambda_{Y'\rvert R=1/2}^{(XY)}$ and $\lambda_{W'\rvert R=1/2}^{(XY)}$ represent $\lambda_{Y'}^{(XY)}$ and $\lambda_{W'}^{(XY)}$ when evaluated at $R=1/2$ (Equations \ref{eq:lambda_neoY} and \ref{eq:lambda_neoW}).
That is, recombination between the selected locus and the novel sex-determining locus, $R$, does not enter into the $k=1/2$ results.
This is because sex is essentially randomized each generation, %as if the novel sex-determiner were on an unlinked site that half the time acts as a neo-W and half the time as a neo-Y.
preventing associations from building up between alleles at locus $\mathbf{A}$ and sex. 
Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_ESD} shows that the ESD mutation gets half of the fitness of a feminizing mutation (neo-W) and half of the fitness of a masculinizing mutation (neo-Y), but only has an effect one half of the time (the other half of the time it produces the same sex as the ancestral system would have).

}\DIFaddend %An important result from Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_ESD} is that ESD can invade if there is haploid selection. 
%When evaluated at $R=1/2$, $\Lambda_{Y',XY}$ is necessarily less than one, but $\Lambda_{W',XY}$ can be greater than one if there is haploid selection, as discussed above. 
%Previous studies where ESD is favoured have typically assumed that environmental conditions (e.g., maternal condition, mate quality, age, or host size) can differentially affect the fitness of males versus females such that ESD invades because it allows sex determination to depend on the environment \citep[reviewed in][]{Charnov:1982wg,Bull:1983vi,West:2009we}. 
%Here, ESD mutations can spread because they generate females that are either rare or have high fitness, in the same manner as a neo-W. 

Significantly, Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_ESD} is the same whether ESD is invading an ancestrally XY or ZW system (because $\lambda_{Y'}^{(XY)} = \lambda_{W'}^{(ZW)}$ and $\lambda_{W'}^{(XY)} = \lambda_{Y'}^{(ZW)}$).
Thus, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fisherian sex ratio selection alone does not easily }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{focusing solely on Fisherian selection to equalize the sex-ratio does not fully }\DIFaddend explain GSD to ESD transitions.
For example, when the ancestral sex-determining system is XY \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, but not ZW, }\DIFdelend the sex ratio is biased by male haploid selection.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When the ancestral sex-determining system is ZW the sex ratio is not biased.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Two predominant theories explaining the remarkably high frequency of transitions between sex-determining systems are sexually-antagonistic selection and sex ratio selection (reviewed in~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

The former predicts that new sex-determining alleles can invade when they arise in closer linkage with a sexually-antagonistic locus ($r<R$,~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

In contrast to these prevailing views, we show that selection (including sexually-antagonistic selection, overdominance, and}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section*{\DIFadd{Discussion}}

\DIFaddend On one hand, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend biases caused by haploid selection can facilitate trans-GSD transitions or transitions from genetic to environmental sex determination\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

For instance, alleles favoured by haploid selection in males often become associated with the Y allele, which leads to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an ancestral }\DIFaddend male-biased zygotic sex ratio.
This male bias increases the potential for a neo-W \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or ESD }\DIFaddend allele to invade (Table \ref{tab:haplotype_growth}), which can equalize the sex ratio (e.g., see Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}B, for related examples see~\cite{Kozielska:2010vm}).
%DIF < We find that sex ratio biases caused by haploid selection can also affect transitions between sex-determining systems (e.g., see $\zeta$ terms in Table \ref{tab:haplotype_growth}). 
%DIF > We find that sex-ratio biases caused by haploid selection can also affect transitions between sex-determining systems (e.g., see $\zeta$ terms in Table \ref{tab:haplotype_growth}). 
%However, the neo-W may not equalize the sex ratio (e.g., if the driving allele also drives in females or affects competition among eggs)
On the other hand, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend selection can be overwhelmed by additional selective effects, preventing a neo-W or ESD allele from invading, even if it would balance the sex ratio (e.g., when selection \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend acts in opposite directions in male and female diploids, Table \ref{tab:specialcases}). %and equalizing the sex ratio.
Indeed, transitions between sex-determining systems can generate stronger \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend biases (e.g., Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}A and step 1 in~\cite{Ubeda:2015fx}).
%For example, where a neo-Y invades and is linked with a locus that experiences haploid selection in male gametes, the sex ratio evolves to become biased \citep[e.g., see Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}A and step 1 in][]{Ubeda:2015fx}.
%For example, in an ancestral ZW system, haploid selection in males can allow a linked neo-Y to invade, despite the fact that it creates a male-biased sex ratio because the neo-Y becomes associated with the driven allele (Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}A).

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We note that we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our models }\DIFaddend assume that sex-determining alleles do not experience direct selection except via their associations with sex and selected alleles.
However, in some cases, there may be significant degeneration around the sex-limited allele (Y or W) in the ancestral sex-determining region because recessive deleterious mutations and/or deletions accumulate in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the surrounding }\DIFaddend non-recombining regions~\cite{Rice:1996ke,Charlesworth:2000cc,Bachtrog:2006ed,Marais:2008hm}. 
During trans-GSD transitions, but not cis-GSD transitions, any recessive deleterious alleles linked to the Y or W are revealed to selection in YY or WW individuals~\cite{Bachtrog:2014bx}. 
This phenomenon was studied by van Doorn and Kirkpatrick (2010)~\cite{vanDoorn:2010hu}, who found that degeneration can prevent fixation of a neo-W or a neo-Y allele, leading to a mixed sex-determining system where the ancestral and new sex-determining loci are both segregating.

%While not explicitly studied, we also predict that Y or W degeneration would prevent fixation of the new sex-determining genes considered here.
Degeneration around the Y or W could explain why trans-GSD transitions are not observed to be much more common than cis-GSD transitions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\textcolor{red}{(citation?)} }\DIFaddend despite the fact that our models demonstrate that they are favoured under a wider range of conditions, especially with haploid selection. 
For example, there are a dozen sex chromosome configurations among Dipteran species but only one transition between male and female heterogamety~\cite{Vicoso:2015hf}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but Y degeneration or absence is also very common among }\textit{\DIFadd{Diptera}}\DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend . 

%Limitation 3: don't consider m alleles with similar k to ancester, no ancestral ESD considered
In this study, we have only considered new sex-determining alleles of large effect. 
However, we expect similar selective forces to act on masculinizing/feminizing alleles of weaker effect.
For example, small effect masculinizing/feminizing alleles within a threshold model of sex determination can be favoured when linked to loci that experience sexually-antagonistic selection~\cite{Muralidhar2018}. 
These results echo those for large-effect neo-Y/neo-W alleles~\cite{vanDoorn:2007eu,vanDoorn:2010hu}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, while we have considered cis-GSD, trans-GSD, and GSD to ESD transitions, we have not explicitly considered ESD to GSD transitions.

}\DIFaddend .

%Limitation 2: TWO ALLELE DRIVE
%Another simplification that we made is that meiotic drive involves only a single locus with two alleles. 
%However, many meiotic drive systems involve an interaction with another locus at which alleles may `suppress' the action of meiotic drive \citep[][]{Burt:2006,Lindholm:2016cw}.
%Thus, the dynamics of meiotic drive alleles can be heavily dependent on the interaction between two loci and the recombination rate between them, which in turn can be affected by sex-linkage if there is reduced recombination between sex chromosomes~\cite{Hurst:1991uh}.
%Furthermore, in some cases, a driving allele may act by killing any gametes that carry a `target' allele at another locus, in which case there can be fertility effects that alter the equilibrium frequency of a meiotic drive allele~\cite{Holman:2015en}. 
%In polygamous mating systems, the intensity of pollen/sperm competition can depend on the density of males available to donate pollen/sperm, which can itself depend on the sex ratio~\cite{Taylor:2002wu}. 
%In terms of our model, this implies that the strength of gametic competition ($t^\male$) may both determine and be determined by the sex ratio. 
%How the evolution of new sex-determining mechanisms could be influenced by two-locus meiotic drive and/or by ecological feedbacks under different mating systems remains to be studied.

\section*{Conclusion}

We have shown that tight sex-linkage and haploid selection can drive previously unexpected transitions between sex-determining systems.
In particular, both can select for new sex-determining loci that are more loosely linked to loci under selection \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Conclusions 1A-1C \& 2B)}\DIFaddend . 
In addition, haploid selection can cause transitions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in GSD }\DIFaddend analogous to those caused by purely sexually-antagonistic selection, eliminating the need for differences in selection between male and female diploids \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Conclusion 2A)}\DIFaddend .
We conclude that haploid selection should be considered as a pivotal factor driving transitions between sex-determining systems. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Perhaps counterintuitively}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Further}\DIFaddend , transitions involving haploid selection can be driven by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend selection or cause \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sex ratio }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sex-ratio }\DIFaddend biases to evolve; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we do not find Fisherian sex ratio selection to be an overwhelming force}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to leading order, selection to balance the sex ratio and the benefits of hitch-hiking with haploid selected alleles are of equal magnitude (Conclusions 3 \& 4)}\DIFaddend . 
Overall, our results suggest several new scenarios under which new sex-determining systems are favoured, which could help to explain why the evolution of sex-determining systems is so dynamic.

\label{fig:positionOverdominance}
{\bf With overdominance, loci near to the ancestral sex-determining locus ($r\approx0$) can favour neo-W alleles that are less tightly linked ($R>r$).} 
In panels A and B, the $a$ allele is favoured in females ($w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$w_{Aa}^\circ=1$}\DIFaddend , $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$) and selection in males is overdominant ($w_{aa}^\male=w_{AA}^\male=0.75$).
In panels C and D, selection in males and females is overdominant ($w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$, $w_{aa}^\male=0.5$, $w_{AA}^\male=0.7$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$w_{Aa}^\circ=1$}\DIFaddend ).
There is no haploid selection \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t^\Hermaphrodite = \alpha^\Hermaphrodite_\Delta = 0$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t^\circ = \alpha^\circ_\Delta = 0$}\DIFaddend .
These parameters are marked by daggers in Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}B and C, which show that neo-W invasion is expected for any $R$ ($\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)},\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$) if the $a$ allele is nearly fixed on the Y (black lines in this figure; not stable for $r>>0$). 
Equilibria where the $A$ allele is more common among Y-bearing male gametes can also be stable and allow neo-W invasion for these parameters (blue lines). 
%The weak selection approximation holds when all recombination rates are large relative to selection (around 0 in panels A and C), in which case, in the absence of haploid selection, neo-W alleles should spread if and only if they are more tightly linked to the selected locus (positive invasion fitness if and only if the selected locus is in the grey region). 
%However, when recombination rates are small (panels B and D and when the selected locus is near the SDRs in all panels), this weak selection prediction can break down. 

\paragraph*{S2 Fig.}
\label{fig:temporalOverdominance}
{\bf Following invasion by a neo-W allele, there can be a complete transition to a new sex-determining system, maintenance of both ancestral-XY and neo-ZW sex determining systems, or loss of the new sex-determining allele.}  
Here, we plot the frequency of the neo-W allele among female gametes.
%; as the neo-W reaches frequency $0.5$, polymorphism at the ancestral XY locus is lost with Y becoming fixed such that sex is determined only be the ZW allele carried by a female gamete. 
Panels A, C and D show cases where a steady state is reached with the neo-W at a frequency below $0.5$, in which case ancestral-X and Y alleles also both segregate. 
In all cases, we assume that the $a$ allele is initially more common than the $A$ allele on the Y background (Y-$a$ is fixed when $r=0$). 
When $r>0$ (panels B and D), Y-$A$ haplotypes created by recombination can become more common than Y-$a$ haplotypes as the neo-W spreads.
In B, this leads to loss of the neo-W and the system goes to an equilibrium with X-$a$ and Y-$A$ haplotypes fixed (equilibrium $A'$), such that all females have the high fitness genotype $aa$ and all males are $Aa$. 
For the parameters in B, neo-W alleles have negative invasion fitness when the Y-$A$ haplotype is ancestrally more common than Y-$a$ (compare blue to black curves in \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}A and  \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}B near the ancestral sex-determining locus). 
In contrast, the neo-W is not lost in panel D as it is favoured regardless of whether Y-$A$ or Y-$a$ haplotypes predominate (again, compare blue to black curves in \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}C and  \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}D). 
%DIF < Fitness parameters are the same as in \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}; in panels A and B the $a$ allele is favoured in females ($w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$) while there is overdominance in males ($w_{aa}^\male=w_{AA}^\male=0.75$) and in panels C and D, there is overdominance in both sexes ($w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$, $w_{aa}^\male=0.5$, $w_{AA}^\male=0.7$, $w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$). 
%DIF > Fitness parameters are the same as in \nameref{fig:positionOverdominance}; in panels A and B the $a$ allele is favoured in females ($w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{Aa}^\circ=1$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$) while there is overdominance in males ($w_{aa}^\male=w_{AA}^\male=0.75$) and in panels C and D, there is overdominance in both sexes ($w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$, $w_{aa}^\male=0.5$, $w_{AA}^\male=0.7$, $w_{Aa}^\circ=1$). 
%These parameters are marked by a dagger in Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}. 
%DIF < Here, there is no haploid selection $t^\Hermaphrodite = \alpha^\Hermaphrodite_\Delta = 0$.
%DIF > Here, there is no haploid selection $t^\circ = \alpha^\circ_\Delta = 0$.

\paragraph*{S3 Fig.}
\label{fig:SexAntagTighterMaleDrive}
{\bf  When there is sexually-antagonistic selection and haploid selection, a neo-W allele may invade for any $R$.}
Panel A shows that the invasion fitness of a neo-W is positive, even when $r<R$ (unshaded region).
In panel B, we vary the recombination rate between the neo-W and the selected locus ($R$) for a fixed recombination rate between the ancestral sex-determining locus and the selected locus ($r=0.005$).
Coloured markers show recombination rates for which the temporal dynamics of neo-W invasion are plotted in panel C (black $R=0.001$, red $R=0.02$, blue $R=0.1$, green $R=0.5$). 
The diploid selection parameters used in this plot are the same as in Fig \ref{fig:SexAntagTighter}. 
There is also meiotic drive in males favouring $a$ ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male=-0.08$), this full set of parameters is marked by an asterisk in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}A.
When $R=0.5$ (green curve), the neo-W does not reach fixation and X, Y, Z, and W alleles are all maintained in the population, see \nameref{fig:freqAll}C.

\paragraph*{S4 Fig.}
\label{fig:regionMaleDrive}
{\bf Parameters for which neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes spread when there is male meiotic drive at a locus that is tightly linked to the ancestral XY locus ($r=0$).}
This figure is equivalent to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots} but with meiotic drive in males.
%DIF < We vary the fitness of male homozygotes relative to heterozygotes ($w_{Aa}^\Hermaphrodite=1$) and only consider stable equilibria at which both $\mathbf{A}$ locus allele are maintained and the $a$ allele is initially fixed on the Y, region outlined. 
%DIF > We vary the fitness of male homozygotes relative to heterozygotes ($w_{Aa}^\circ=1$) and only consider stable equilibria at which both $\mathbf{A}$ locus allele are maintained and the $a$ allele is initially fixed on the Y, region outlined. 
In panels A-C, meiotic drive in males favours the $a$ allele ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male=-0.16$), creating male-biased sex ratios and generally increasing $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$. 
By contrast, $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ tend to be reduced when meiotic drive in males favours the $A$ allele ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male=0.16$), panels D-F. 
%We consider three forms of selection in females: directional selection in favour of the $A$ allele (panels A and D, $w_{aa}^\female=0.85$, $w_{AA}^\female=1.05$), direction selection in favour of the $a$ allele (panels B and E, $w_{aa}^\female=1.05$, $w_{AA}^\female=0.85$), and overdominance (panels C and F, $w_{aa}^\female=w_{AA}^\female=0.6$).

\paragraph*{S5 Fig.}
\label{fig:regionMaleGS}
{\bf Parameters for which neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes spread when there is male gametic competition at a locus that is tightly linked to the ancestral XY locus ($r=0$).}
This figure is equivalent to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots} but with gametic competition in males.
%DIF < Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\Hermaphrodite$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}. 
%DIF > Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\circ$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}. 
The $a$ allele is favoured during male gametic competition in Panels A-C ($w_{a}^\male=1.16$, $w_{A}^\male=1$), which creates male biased sex ratios and increases $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$. 
By contrast, $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ tend to be reduced when the $A$ allele is favoured during male gametic competition, panels D-F.
Compared to the meiotic drive parameters in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}, the effect of these male gametic competition parameters on the sex ratio is smaller. 
For example, in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}A-C, the ancestral sex ratio is $\alpha^\male=0.58$ at equilibrium (B) and in panels A-C of this plot, the ancestral sex ratio is $w_{a}^\male/(w_{A}^\male+w_{a}^\male)=0.537$ at equilibrium (B). 

\paragraph*{S6 Fig.}
\label{fig:regionFemaleDrive}
{\bf Parameters for which neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes spread when there is female meiotic drive at a locus that is tightly linked to the ancestral XY locus ($r=0$).}
This figure is equivalent to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots} but with meiotic drive in females.
%DIF < Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\Hermaphrodite$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive} and \nameref{fig:regionMaleGS}. 
%DIF > Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\circ$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive} and \nameref{fig:regionMaleGS}. 
The $a$ allele is favoured by meiotic drive in females in Panels A-C ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\female=-0.16$), which increases $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ and decreases $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$. 
Female meiotic drive in favour of the $A$ allele (panels D-F, $\alpha_{\Delta}^\female=-0.16$) has the opposite effect. 

\paragraph*{S7 Fig.}
\label{fig:regionFemaleGS}
{\bf Parameters for which neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes spread when there is female gametic competition at a locus that is tightly linked to the ancestral XY locus ($r=0$).}
This figure is equivalent to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots} but with gametic competition in females.
%DIF < Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\Hermaphrodite$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}, \nameref{fig:regionMaleGS}, and \nameref{fig:regionFemaleDrive}. 
%DIF > Diploid selection parameters ($w_{ij}^\circ$) are the same as those in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}, \nameref{fig:regionMaleGS}, and \nameref{fig:regionFemaleDrive}. 
The $a$ allele is favoured during female gametic competition in females in Panels A-C ($w_{a}^\female=1.16$, $w_{A}^\female=1$), which increases $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ and decreases $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$. 
The $A$ allele is favoured during gametic competition in panels D-F ($w_{a}^\female=1$, $w_{A}^\female=1.16$), giving the opposite effect on $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$. 

\paragraph*{S8 Fig.}
\label{fig:regionPloidAntag}
{\bf Ploidally-antagonistic selection can drive the spread of neo-W alleles. }
A-D show when each of the neo-W haplotypes invades an internally stable equilibrium with $a$ fixed on the Y (found by setting $r=0$).
The y-axis shows directional selection in diploids of both sexes, $s^\female=s^\male$, and the x-axes show sex-specific drive, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\alpha_\Delta^\Hermaphrodite$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\alpha_\Delta^\circ$}\DIFaddend , or haploid competition, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t^\Hermaphrodite$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t^\circ$}\DIFaddend .
The top left and bottom right quadrants therefore imply ploidally-antagonistic selection (and these are the only places where neo-W haplotypes can invade).
Dominance is equal in both sexes, $h^\female=h^\male=3/4$. 
E-F show the temporal dynamics of neo-W frequency in females with parameters given by the asterisks in the corresponding A-D plot, with $r=1/200$, for four different $R$.
Black $R=1/1000$, Red $R=2/100$, Blue $R=1/10$, Green $R=1/2$.  

\paragraph*{S9 Fig.}
\label{fig:freqAll}
{\bf Pseudo-fixation of neo-W or maintenance of multiple sex-determining alleles. }
The curves show the frequencies of the neo-W (red), ancestral Y (blue), and $A$ allele (black) among female gametes (solid curves) and among male gametes (dashed curves). 
In panel A, there is a complete transition from XY sex determination (XX-ZZ females and XY-ZZ males) to ZW sex determination (YY-ZW females and YY-ZZ males).  
In panels B and C a polymorphism is maintained at both the ancestral XY locus and the new ZW locus, such that there are males with genotypes XY-ZZ and YY-ZZ and females with genotypes XX-ZZ, XX-ZW, XY-ZW, and YY-ZW. 
In panel A, selection is ploidally-antagonistic with drive in males (parameters as in the green curve in Fig \ref{fig:SexRatioBad}B).
In panel B, there is overdominance in both sexes and no haploid selection (parameters as in the green curve in \nameref{fig:temporalOverdominance}C).
In panel C, there is sexually-antagonistic selection in diploids with drive in males (parameters as in the green curve in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}C).
In all cases, the initial equilibrium frequency has $a$ near fixation on the Y.

%In each generation we census the genotype frequencies in male and female gametes/gametophytes (hereafter, gametes) between meiosis (and any meiotic drive) and gametic competition. 
%DIF < At this stage we denote the frequencies of X- and Y-bearing gametes from males and females $x_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}$ and $y_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}$.
%DIF < The superscript $\Hermaphrodite \in \{\male,\female\}$ specifies the sex of the diploid that the gamete came from. 
%DIF > At this stage we denote the frequencies of X- and Y-bearing gametes from males and females $x_{i}^{\circ}$ and $y_{i}^{\circ}$.
%DIF > The superscript $\circ \in \{\male,\female\}$ specifies the sex of the diploid that the gamete came from. 
%The subscript $i\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ specifies the genotype at the selected locus $\mathbf{A}$ and at the novel sex-determining locus $\mathbf{M}$, where $1=AM$, $2=aM$, $3=Am$, and $4=am$. 
%DIF < The gamete frequencies from each sex sum to one, $\sum_{i}x_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}+y_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}=1$. 
%DIF > The gamete frequencies from each sex sum to one, $\sum_{i}x_{i}^{\circ}+y_{i}^{\circ}=1$. 
%
%DIF < Competition then occurs among gametes of the same sex (e.g., among eggs and among sperm separately) according to the genotype at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus ($w_{1}^\Hermaphrodite=w_{3}^\Hermaphrodite=w_{A}^\Hermaphrodite$, $w_{2}^\Hermaphrodite=w_{4}^\Hermaphrodite=w_{a}^\Hermaphrodite$, see Table \ref{tab:fitnesstable}).
%DIF < The genotype frequencies after gametic competition are $x_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite,s}= w_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}x_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}/\bar{w}_{H}^{\Hermaphrodite}$ and $y_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite,s}= w_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}y_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}/\bar{w}_{H}^{\Hermaphrodite}$, where $\bar{w}_{H}^{\Hermaphrodite}=\sum_{i} w_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}x_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}+w_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}y_{i}^{\Hermaphrodite}$ is the mean fitness of male ($\Hermaphrodite=\male$) or female ($\Hermaphrodite=\female$) gametes. 
%DIF > Competition then occurs among gametes of the same sex (e.g., among eggs and among sperm separately) according to the genotype at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus ($w_{1}^\circ=w_{3}^\circ=w_{A}^\circ$, $w_{2}^\circ=w_{4}^\circ=w_{a}^\circ$, see Table \ref{tab:fitnesstable}).
%DIF > The genotype frequencies after gametic competition are $x_{i}^{\circ,s}= w_{i}^{\circ}x_{i}^{\circ}/\bar{w}_{H}^{\circ}$ and $y_{i}^{\circ,s}= w_{i}^{\circ}y_{i}^{\circ}/\bar{w}_{H}^{\circ}$, where $\bar{w}_{H}^{\circ}=\sum_{i} w_{i}^{\circ}x_{i}^{\circ}+w_{i}^{\circ}y_{i}^{\circ}$ is the mean fitness of male ($\circ=\male$) or female ($\circ=\female$) gametes. 
%
%Random mating then occurs between gametes to produce diploid zygotes.
%%To shorten notation we now use index $i$ (and $j$) to denote the alleles at both the $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ loci and label $MA=1$, $Ma=2$, $mA=3$, and $ma=4$, such that $i,j\in\{1,2,3,4\}$.
%The frequencies of XX zygotes are then denoted as $xx_{ij}$, XY zygotes as $xy_{ij}$, and YY zygotes as $yy_{ij}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ locus genotypes are given by $i,j\in\{1,2,3,4\}$, as above. 
%In XY zygotes, the haplotype inherited from an X-bearing gamete is given by $i$ and the haplotype from a Y-bearing gamete is given by $j$. 
%In XX and YY zygotes, individuals with diploid genotype $ij$ are equivalent to those with diploid genotype $ji$; for simplicity, we use $xx_{ij}$ and $yy_{ij}$ with $i\neq j$ to denote the average of these frequencies, $xx_{ij}=(x_{i}^{\female,s}x_{j}^{\male,s}+x_{j}^{\female,s}x_{i}^{\male,s})/2$ and $yy_{ij}=(y_{i}^{\female,s}y_{j}^{\male,s}+y_{j}^{\female,s}y_{i}^{\male,s})/2$. 
%
%
%Denoting the $\mathbf{M}$ locus genotype by $b \in \{MM, Mm, mm\}$ and the $\mathbf{X}$ locus genotype by $c \in \{XX, XY, YY\}$, zygotes develop as females with probability $k_{bc}$. 
%Therefore, the frequencies of XX females are given by $xx_{ij}^{\female}=k_{bc}xx_{ij}$, XY females are given by $xy_{ij}^{\female}=k_{bc}xy_{ij}$, and YY females are given by $yy_{ij}^{\female}=k_{bc}yy_{ij}$. 
%Similarly, XX male frequencies are $xx_{ij}^{\male}=(1-k_{bc})xx_{ij}$, XY male frequencies are $xy_{ij}^{\male}=(1-k_{bc})xy_{ij}$, and YY males frequencies are $yy_{ij}^{\male}=(1-k_{bc})yy_{ij}$.
%This notation allows both the ancestral and novel sex-determining regions to determine zygotic sex according to an XY system, a ZW system, or an environmental sex-determining system. 
%In addition, we can consider any epistatic dominance relationship between the two sex-determining loci. 
%Here, we assume that the ancestral sex-determining system ($\mathbf{X}$ locus) is XY ($k_{MMXX}=1$ and $k_{MMXY}=k_{MMYY}=0$) or ZW ($k_{MMZZ}=0$ and $k_{MMZW}=k_{MMWW}=1$) and epistatically recessive to a dominant novel sex-determining locus, $\mathbf{M}$ ($k_{Mmc}=k_{mmc}=k$). 
%
%
%Selection among diploids then occurs according to the diploid genotype at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus, $l \in \{AA, Aa, aa\}$, for an individual of type $ij$ (see Table \ref{tab:fitnesstable}). 
%DIF < The diploid frequencies after selection in sex $\Hermaphrodite$ are given by $xx_{ij}^{\Hermaphrodite,s}=w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite} xx_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\Hermaphrodite}_{D}$, $xy_{ij}^{\Hermaphrodite,s}=w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite} xy_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\Hermaphrodite}_{D}$, and $yy_{ij}^{\Hermaphrodite,s}=w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite} yy_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\Hermaphrodite}_{D}$, where $\bar{w}^{\Hermaphrodite}_{D}= \sum_{i=1}^{4}\sum_{j=1}^{4}w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite}xx_{ij}+w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite}xy_{ij}+w_{l}^{\Hermaphrodite}yy_{ij}$ is the mean fitness of diploids of sex $\Hermaphrodite$. 
%DIF > The diploid frequencies after selection in sex $\circ$ are given by $xx_{ij}^{\circ,s}=w_{l}^{\circ} xx_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\circ}_{D}$, $xy_{ij}^{\circ,s}=w_{l}^{\circ} xy_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\circ}_{D}$, and $yy_{ij}^{\circ,s}=w_{l}^{\circ} yy_{ij}/\bar{w}^{\circ}_{D}$, where $\bar{w}^{\circ}_{D}= \sum_{i=1}^{4}\sum_{j=1}^{4}w_{l}^{\circ}xx_{ij}+w_{l}^{\circ}xy_{ij}+w_{l}^{\circ}yy_{ij}$ is the mean fitness of diploids of sex $\circ$. 
%
%Finally, these diploids undergo meiosis to produce the next generation of gametes. 
%Recombination and sex-specific meiotic drive occur during meiosis.
%%We can also assume that recombination is sex specific and/or affected by the M locus - but generally we don't so I just describe $R=R_{f}=R, r_{MM,d}=r_{Mm,d}=r_{mm,d}=r, \chi_{m}=\chi_{f}=\chi$.
%Here, we allow any relative locations for the $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ loci by using three parameters to describe the recombination rates between them. 
%$R$ is the recombination rate between the $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ loci, $\rho$ is the recombination rate between the $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ loci, and $r$ is the recombination rate between the $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ loci (Fig \ref{fig:model_outline}). 
%\nameref{tab:chisubstitutions} shows replacements that can be made for each possible ordering of the loci assuming that there is no cross-over interference.

%\section*{S2 Appendix}
%
%\subsection*{Resident equilibria and stability}
%
%In the resident population (allele $M$ fixed), we follow the frequency of $A$ in X-bearing female gametes, $p^\female_X$, and X-bearing male gametes, $p^\male_X$, and Y-bearing male gametes, $p^\male_Y$.
%We also track the total frequency of Y among male gametes, $q$, which may deviate from $1/2$ due to meiotic drive in males. 
%These four variables determine the frequencies of the six resident gamete types, which sum to one in each sex: $x_{1}^{\female}=\hat{p}_X^\female$, $x_{2}^{\female}=1-\hat{p}_X^\female$, $x_{1}^{\male}=(1-q)\hat{p}_X^\male$, $x_{2}^{\male}=(1-q)(1-\hat{p}_X^\male)$, $y_{1}^{\male}=q \hat{p}_Y^\male$, and $y_{2}^{\male}=q(1-\hat{p}_Y^\male)$. 
%Mean fitnesses in the resident population are given in \nameref{tab:meanfitnesses}.
%
%Various forms of selection can maintain a polymorphism at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus, including sexually antagonistic selection, overdominance, conflicts between diploid selection and selection upon haploid genotypes (ploidally-antagonsitic selection,~\cite{Immler:2012tl}), or a combination of these selective regimes (see below). 
%
%In particular special cases, e.g., no sex-differences in selection or meiotic drive ($s^\male=s^\female$, $h^\male=h^\female$, and $\alpha^\male=\alpha^\female=1/2$), the equilibrium allele frequency and stability can be calculated analytically without assuming anything about the relative strengths of selection and recombination. 
%However, here, we focus on two regimes (tight linkage between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ and weak selection) in order to make fewer assumptions about fitnesses. 
%
%\subsubsection*{Tight linkage between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ loci}
%
%We first calculate the equilibria in the ancestral population when the recombination rate between the $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ loci is small ($r$ of order $\epsilon$). 
%Selection at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus will not affect evolution at the novel sex-determining locus, $\mathbf{M}$, if one allele is fixed on all backgrounds. 
%We therefore focus on the five equilibria that maintain both $A$ and $a$ alleles, four of which are given to leading order by:

%\noindent
%A fifth equilibrium $(C)$ also exists where $A$ is present at an intermediate frequency on the Y background ($0<\hat{p}_{Y}^{\male}<1$). 
%However, equilibrium $(C)$ is never locally stable when $r \approx 0$ and is therefore not considered further.
%Thus, the Y background can either be fixed for the $a$ allele (equilibria ($A$) and ($B$)) or the $A$ allele (equilibria ($A'$) and ($B'$)).
%The X background can then either be polymorphic (equilibria ($A$) and ($A'$)) or fixed for the alternative allele (equilibria ($B$) and ($B'$)).
%Since equilibria $(A)$ and $(B)$ are equivalent to equilibria $(A')$ and $(B')$ with the labelling of $A$ and $a$ alleles interchanged, we discuss only equilibria $(A)$ and $(B)$, in which the Y background is fixed for the $a$ allele. 
%DIF < If there is no haploid selection ($\alpha^{\Hermaphrodite}_\Delta=0$, $w_{A}^{\Hermaphrodite}=w_{a}^{\Hermaphrodite}=1$), these equilibria are equivalent to those found by~\cite{Lloyd1977} and~\cite{Otto2014}.
%DIF > If there is no haploid selection ($\alpha^{\circ}_\Delta=0$, $w_{A}^{\circ}=w_{a}^{\circ}=1$), these equilibria are equivalent to those found by~\cite{Lloyd1977} and~\cite{Otto2014}.
%
%We next calculate when equilibria $(A)$ and $(B)$ are locally stable for $r=0$. 
%According to the `small parameter theory'~\cite{Karlin:1972ab,Karlin:1972dq}, these stability properties are unaffected by small amounts of recombination between the sex-determining locus and the $\mathbf{A}$ locus, although equilibrium frequencies may be slightly altered. 
%For the $a$ allele to be stably fixed on the Y background we need $\bar{w}_{Ya}^{\male} > \bar{w}_{YA}^{\male}$ where $\bar{w}_{Ya}^{\male} = w_{a}^{\male} \big[\hat{p}_X^\female(1-\alpha^\male_\Delta) w_{A}^{\female} w_{Aa}^{\male} + (1-\hat{p}_X^\female)w_{a}^{\female} w_{aa}^{\male} \big]$ and $\bar{w}_{YA}^{\male} = w_{A}^{\male} \big[ \hat{p}_X^\female w_{A}^{\female} w_{AA}^{\male} + (1-\hat{p}_X^\female)(1+\alpha^\male_\Delta) w_{a}^{\female} w_{Aa}^{\male} \big]$. 
%That is, Y-$a$ haplotypes must have higher fitness than Y-$A$ haplotypes.  
%Substituting in $\hat{p}_X^\female$ from Eq \eqref{eq:tightequil}, fixation of the $a$ allele on the Y background requires that $\gamma_{i}>0$ where $\gamma_{(A)}=w_{a}^{\male} \big[ (1-\alpha^\male_\Delta) w_{Aa}^{\male} \phi + w_{aa}^{\male} \psi \big]-w_{A}^{\male} \big[ w_{AA}^{\male} \phi + (1 + \alpha^{\male}_\Delta)w_{Aa}^{\male} \psi \big]$ for equilibrium $(A)$ and $\gamma_{(B)}=(1-\alpha^{\male}_\Delta)w_{a}^{\male}w_{Aa}^{\male}-w_{A}^{\male}w_{AA}^{\male}$ for equilibrium $(B)$.
%Stability of a polymorphism on the X background (equilibrium $(A)$) further requires that $\phi >0$ and $\psi >0$.

%\subsection*{Invasion conditions}
%
%A rare neo-Y or neo-W allele, $m$, will spread in an XY sex-determining system when the leading eigenvalue, $\lambda_m^{(XY)}$, of the Jacobian matrix derived from the eight mutant recursion equations (given by \ref{eq:recursions}c,d,g,h), evaluated at the ancestral equilibrium, is greater than one.
%However, because a neo-Y (neo-W) is always in males (females) and is epistatically dominant to the ancestral sex-determining locus, the characteristic polynomial factors into two quadratics times $(\lambda_m^{(XY)})^4$.  
%One quadratic governs the change in the frequency of the new sex determination factor associated with the $A$ and $a$ allele frequencies, summing across backgrounds at the old sex-determining locus (i.e., summing haplotypes bearing the original X and Y alleles). 
%%It is the largest root of this quadratic that determines the spread of the new $m$ allele (see details in \nameref{file:Mathematica}).  
%The second quadratic describes the dynamics of the difference in the $m$-$A$ and $m$-$a$ haplotypes between X and Y backgrounds.  
%Asymptotically, this difference is constrained to grow at a rate equal to or less than the sum while the $m$ allele is rare, because the frequencies can never become negative. 
%We therefore focus on the leading eigenvalue, $\lambda_m^{(XY)}$, which is the largest root of the first quadratic $f(x) = x^2+ b x + c = 0$, as described in the text (details in \nameref{file:Mathematica}).  
%
%When $R=0$ the two roots are $\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}$, and the leading eigenvalue is the larger of the two.
%When $R>0$ then $f(\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)})$ and $f(\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)})$ are of opposite signs, and the leading eigenvalue must fall between these two quantities (details in \nameref{file:Mathematica}). %(the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that the largest eigenvalue is positive, unique, and real).  
%Thus, $\lambda_m^{(XY)}>1$ if both $\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}>1$ and $\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}>1$; similarly, $\lambda_m^{(XY)}<1$ if both $\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}<1$ and $\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}<1$.
%If only one haplotypic growth rate is greater than one ($\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}<1<\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}$ or $\Lambda_{mA}^{(XY)}<1<\Lambda_{ma}^{(XY)}$), then $\lambda_m^{(XY)}$ is greater than one when condition \eqref{eq:lambdasGen} is met. 
%Thus, the invasion of a new sex-determining allele is determined by the haplotypic growth rates ($\Lambda_{mj}^{(XY)}$ terms), which do not account for loss due to recombination, and the rates at which recombination between the $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ loci breaks apart these haplotypes ($\chi_{mj}^{(XY)}$).
%For tight linkage between the ancestral sex-determining locus ($\mathbf{X}$) and the selected locus ($\mathbf{A}$) we can calculate these terms explicitly (see below).
%For weak selection we approximate the leading eigenvalue with a Taylor series. 
%The leading eigenvalue for any $k$ is given up to order $\epsilon^2$ by Eq \eqref{eq:lambda_ESD_k}.
%
%\subsubsection*{Tight linkage between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ ($r \approx 0$)}
%
%Here, we explore the conditions under which a neo-W invades an XY system assuming that the $\mathbf{A}$ locus is initially in tight linkage with the ancestral sex-determining locus ($r \approx 0$). 
%We disregard neo-Y mutations, which never spread given that the ancestral population is at a stable equilibrium (see \nameref{file:Mathematica} for proof). 
%
%Starting with the simpler $(B)$ equilibrium, the terms that determine the leading eigenvalue are
%
%\begin{subequations}\label{Binvasion}

%%\noindent
%%In this case, the zygotic sex ratio ($\zeta$) is given by the difference in haploid selection in males on $a$ (fixed on the Y) and $A$ (fixed on the X) alleles, i.e., there are more males than females if $\zeta = \alpha^\male w_A^\male / [(1-\alpha^\male)w_a^\male + \alpha^\male w_A^\male]<1/2$. %$\alpha^\male<1/2$ and/or $w_{a}^\male>w_{A}^\male$. 
%%Populations with haploid selection for $a$ in males have a male biased zygotic sex ratio are thus more permissive to invasion by a neo-W ($\Lambda_{mA}$ and $\Lambda_{ma}$ larger).
%%%In addition, the spread of neo-W alleles depends on the fitness of female diploids after mating with an X-$A$ or Y-$a$ male gamete, relative to the fitness of females in the population (all have genotype $AA$ and fitness $w_{AA}^\female$ at this equilibrium). 
%%Haploid selection in males has a second effect; the spread rate of neo-W haplotypes is determined by their fitness in diploid females, which depends on their diploid genotype and thus on the male gamete they pair with. 
%%Zygotes carrying dominant neo-W alleles will develop as females regardless of their genotype at the XY locus. 
%%Therefore, neo-W females result from matings with either X-$A$ or Y-$a$ male gametes. 
%%The relative proportion of these male gametes is determined by haploid selection in males; mating with a Y-$a$ male gamete is more likely if the $a$ allele is favoured during male gamete production or competition ($\zeta<1/2$). 
%%Thus, neo-W females experience different diploid selection than XX females, and the extent of this difference depends on haploid selection in males.
%%Furthermore, haploid selection in females can directly select upon neo-W-$A$ or neo-W-$a$ haplotypes. 
%%A neo-W-$A$ female gamete has the same fitness during haploid competition as resident $A$-bearing female gametes. 
%%On the other hand, neo-W-$a$ female gametes can be favoured or disfavoured during female haploid competition (favoured if $w_{a}^\female>w_{A}^\female$). 
%%Meiotic drive in females ($\alpha^\female$) similarly affects the fitness of these neo-W haplotypes, except that it impacts both haplotypes as meiotic drive only occurs in heterozygotes and therefore does not occur in resident XX females (who are always homozygote $AA$). 
%
%Haploid selection impacts the spread of neo-W haplotypes in three ways (also seen in Table \ref{tab:haplotype_growth}).
%Firstly, the zygotic sex ratio becomes male biased, $\zeta>1/2$, when the $a$ allele (which is fixed on the Y) is favoured during competition among male gametes or by meiotic drive in males.
%Specifically, at equilibrium $(B)$, female zygote frequency is $1 - \zeta = w_A^\male (1+\alpha^\male_\Delta) / (2\bar{w}_{H}^\male)$ where $2\bar{w}_{H}^\male= \big[w_a^\male (1-\alpha^\male_\Delta) +  w_A^\male (1+\alpha^\male_\Delta) \big]$ has been canceled out in equations \eqref{Binvasion} to leave the term ${\left[w_{A}^\male (1+\alpha^\male_\Delta) \right]}^{-1}$. 
%Male biased sex ratios facilitate the spread of a neo-W because neo-W alleles cause the zygotes that carry them to develop as the rarer, female, sex. 
%
%Secondly, haploid selection in females selects on neo-W haplotypes directly.
%At equilibrium $(B)$, the fitness of female gametes under the ancestral sex-determining system is $w_{A}^\female$ such that the relative fitnesses of neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes during female gametic competition are $w_{A}^\female/w_{A}^\female$ and $w_{a}^\female/w_{A}^\female$ (see terms in equation \ref{Binvasion}). 
%Meiotic drive in females will also change the proportion of gametes that carry the $A$ versus $a$ alleles, which will be produced by heterozygous females in proportions $(1+\alpha_{\Delta}^\female)/2$ and $(1-\alpha_{\Delta}^\female)/2$, respectively. 
%These terms are only associated with heterozygous females, i.e., they are found alongside $w_{Aa}^\female$.
%
%Thirdly, haploid selection in males affects the diploid genotypes of females by altering the allele frequencies in the male gametes with which female gametes pair.
%At equlibrium $(B)$, neo-W female gametes will mate with X-$A$ male gametes with probability $ w_A^\male (1+\alpha^\male_\Delta) / (2\bar{w}_{H}^\male)$ and Y-$a$ male gametes with probability $w_a^\male (1-\alpha^\male_\Delta) / (2\bar{w}_{H}^\male)$, where the $2\bar{w}_{H}^\male$ terms have been canceled in Eq \eqref{Binvasion} (as mentioned above). 
%Thus, neo-W-$A$ haplotypes are found in $AA$ female diploids with probability $ w_A^\male (1+\alpha^\male_\Delta)/ (2\bar{w}_{H}^\male)$ (e.g., first term in square brackets in the numerator of equation \ref{Binvasion}a) and in $Aa$ female diploids with probability $w_a^\male (1-\alpha^\male_\Delta) / (2\bar{w}_{H}^\male)$ (e.g., the second term in square brackets in the numerator of equation \ref{Binvasion}a).
%
%%For instance, because an epistatically dominant neo-W always causes its carrier to become female, it creates females who carry either Y-$a$ or X-$A$ genotypes from their father.
%%Thus, because when there is a polymorphism the X carries some non-zero frequency of $A$, haploid selection in males impacts the diploid genotypes of females (e.g., creating more $Aa$ females when drive in males favours Y-$a$).
%%How this affects the spread of the neo-W then depends on diploid and haploid selection in females.
%
%The other terms in equations \eqref{Binvasion} are more easily interpreted if we assume that there is no haploid selection in either sex, in which case $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}=(w_{AA}^\female+w_{Aa}^\female)/2 w_{AA}^\female$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}=(w_{aa}^\female+w_{Aa}^\female)/ 2 w_{AA}^\female$.
%Neither haplotype can spread under purely sexually-antagonistic selection at equilibrium $(B)$, with directional selection in each sex.
%Essentially, the X is then already as specialized as possible for the female beneficial allele ($A$ is fixed on the X background), and the neo-W often makes daughters with the Y-$a$ haplotype, increasing the flow of $a$ alleles into females, which reduces the fitness of those females.  
%
%If selection doesn't uniformly favour $A$ in females, however, neo-W-$A$ haplotypes and/or neo-W-$a$ haplotypes can spread ($\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}>1$ and/or $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$).
%%If $\Lambda_{mA}>1$ (requiring $w_{Aa}^\female>w_{AA}^\female$), the implication is that the neo-W can spread alongside the $A$ allele, despite the fact that the neo-W sometimes brings $Y-a$ haplotypes into females, because $a$ is favoured by selection in females despite $A$ being fixed on the X.
%A neo-W-$A$ haplotype can spread ($\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}>1$) when $w_{Aa}^\female>w_{AA}^\female$, despite the fact that a neo-W brings Y-$a$ haplotypes into females.
%In this case the $a$ allele is favoured by selection in females despite $A$ being fixed on the X background.
%For this equilibrium to be stable (i.e.,  to keep $A$ fixed on the X), X-$a$ cannot be overly favoured in females and X-$A$ must be sufficiently favoured in males (for example, by overdominance in males). 
%Specifically, from the stability conditions for equilibrium (B), we must have $w_{Aa}^\female < 2 w_{AA}^\female$ and $w_{Aa}^\male/\big[(w_{aa}^\male+w_{Aa}^\male)/2\big]>w_{Aa}^\female/w_{AA}^\female$. 
%
%Still considering $w_{Aa}^\female>w_{AA}^\female$, the neo-W can also spread alongside the $a$ allele ($\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$) if $w_{aa}^\female$ is large enough such that $(w_{Aa}^\female+w_{aa}^\female)/2>w_{AA}^\female$.
%%there is sufficiently strong underdominance in females ($w_{aa}^\female>w_{Aa}^\female$) \textcolor{blue}{[this is describing directional selection, not overdominance - check the conditions for the case we want to talk about]}, such that $(w_{Aa}^\female+w_{aa}^\female)/2>w_{AA}^\female$.  
%This can occur with overdominance or directional selection for $a$ in females (Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}B,C).
%In this case, $a$ is favoured on the ancestral Y background in males and on the ancestral X background in females (comparing $Aa$ to $AA$ genotypes in females) but $A$ is fixed on the X background due to selection in males. 
%The neo-W-$a$ haplotype can spread because it produces females with higher fitness $Aa$ and $aa$ genotypes. 
%
%%When both haplotypes can spread on their own ($\Lambda_{mA}>1$ and $\Lambda_{ma}>1$), the neo-W invades regardless the recombination rate between it and the selected locus, $R$.
%%When neither haplotype can spread ($\Lambda_{mA}<1$ and $\Lambda_{ma}<1$) the neo-W can never invade.
%%And when only one haplotype can spread on its own the neo-W invades only when the rate of recombination onto the favourable background is sufficiently larger than the rate of recombination off this background (i.e., equation\ref{eq:lambdasGen} is satisfied).
%
%%Haploid selection affects the conclusions outlined above by altering the zygotic sex ratio and exerting direct selection on neo-W haplotypes.
%DIF < %The effect of sex ratio selection is straightforward and can be seen in Eq \eqref{Binvasion}, where male drive and gamete competition for $a$ (which is fixed on the Y and therefore causes a male bias) increases all four terms.
%DIF > %The effect of sex-ratio selection is straightforward and can be seen in Eq \eqref{Binvasion}, where male drive and gamete competition for $a$ (which is fixed on the Y and therefore causes a male bias) increases all four terms.
%%Direct selection on neo-W haplotypes can also be seen in Eq \eqref{Binvasion} by noticing that increasing female drive in favour of $A$ increases the neo-W-$A$ haplotype growth rate ($\Lambda_{mA}$) while female drive and gamete competition in favour of $a$ increases the neo-W-$a$ haplotype growth rate ($\Lambda_{ma}$).
%%Gamete competition in females does not impact the spread of neo-W-$A$ haplotypes because they are on the same background as the resident X.
%%Recombination between the selected locus and the neo-W complicates things slightly, as selective advantages for one neo-W haplotype during the haploid stage in females comes at a cost to the other, and thus recombination off the favoured background becomes more detrimental.

%
%%\textcolor{red}{Sally suggests using some $\zeta$ term in the above equations}
%%\textcolor{blue}{Maybe just reference table 2?}
%
%As with equilibrium (B), haploid selection again modifies invasion fitnesses by altering the ancestral sex ratio, $\zeta$ (see Table \ref{tab:haplotype_growth}), and directly selecting upon female gametes, through $w_{i}^\female$.
%The only difference is that resident XX females are no longer always homozygote $AA$ and males are no longer always heterozygote $Aa$.
%Thus the effect of haploid selection in males is reduced, as is the difference in fitness between neo-W haplotypes and resident X haplotypes, as both can be on any diploid or haploid background.  
%
%The other terms are easier to interpret in the absence of haploid selection.
%For instance, without haploid selection, the neo-W-$A$ haplotype spreads ($\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}>1$) if and only if
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:BeqWAspread}
%2(w_{Aa}^\female-w_{aa}^\female)w_{aa}^\male \psi^2 > (w_{AA}^\female-w_{Aa}^\female)w_{Aa}^\male \phi (\phi-\psi),
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent  
%where $\phi-\psi=w_{AA}^\female w_{Aa}^\male-w_{aa}^\female w_{aa}^\male$ and both $\phi$ and $\psi$ are positive when equilibrium (A) is stable. 
%In contrast to equilibrium (B), a neo-W haplotype can spread under purely sexually-antagonistic selection  ($w_{aa}^\female<w_{Aa}^\female<w_{AA}^\female$ and $w_{AA}^\male<w_{Aa}^\male<w_{aa}^\male$).
%The neo-W-$A$ can spread as long as it becomes associated with females that bear more $A$ alleles than observed at equilibrium (A), effectively specializing on female fitness. 
%%In this case, the neo-W-$A$ haplotype can spread, despite producing a lot of $Aa$ daughters by obtaining the $a$ from Y-gametes, when $aa$ females, which the neo-W-$A$ never makes, are strongly selected against.
%%This can be intuited from the fact that \eqref{eq:BeqWAspread} will be more easily met when $w_{Aa}^\female-w_{aa}^\female\approx w_{Aa}^\female$ and $w_{AA}^\female-w_{Aa}^\female\approx 0$, implying $w_{aa}^\female \approx 0$ and $w_{Aa}^\female\approx w_{AA}^\female$ (although this is complicated by the fact that $w_{aa}^\female$ and $w_{Aa}^\female$ affect $\phi$ and $\psi$ too, the intuition holds). 
%
%Without haploid selection, the neo-W-$a$ haplotype spreads ($\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}>1$) if and only if
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:BeqWaspread}
%(w_{aa}^\female + w_{Aa}^\female-2w_{AA}^\female)w_{Aa}^\male \phi^2 + (w_{aa}^\female-w_{Aa}^\female)(w_{Aa}^\male+2w_{aa}^\male) \phi \psi >0.
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent
%This condition cannot be met with purely sexually antagonistic selection (as both terms on the left-hand side would then be negative), but it can be met under other circumstances. 
%For example, with overdominance in males there is selection for increased $A$ frequencies on the X background in males, which are always paired with Y-$a$ haplotypes.
%Directional selection for $a$ in females can then maintain a polymorphism at the $\mathbf{A}$ locus on the X background.
%This scenario selects for a modifier that increases recombination between the sex chromosomes (e.g., blue region of Fig 2d in~\cite{Otto2014}) and facilitates the spread of neo-W-$a$ haplotypes, which create females bearing more $a$ alleles than the ancestral X haplotype does.

%\subsubsection*{Role of haploid selection with tight linkage between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ loci}
%
%Haploid selection generally expands the conditions under which neo-W alleles can spread within ancestral systems that have evolved tight linkage between the sex-determining locus and a selected locus ($r \approx 0$).
%First, haploid selection can allow a polymorphism to be maintained when it would not under diploid selection alone (e.g., with directional selection in diploids). 
%In cases of ploidally-antagonistic selection, where there is a balance between alleles favored in the haploid stage and the diploid stage, neo-W alleles - even if unlinked to the selected locus - can spread (\nameref{fig:regionPloidAntag}).
%Second, even when diploid selection could itself maintain a polymorphism, haploid selection can increase the conditions under which transitions among sex-determining systems are possible.
%DIF < Of particularly importance, when selection is sexually-antagonistic in diploids ($s^\female s^\male <0$ and $0<h^\Hermaphrodite<1$), an unlinked neo-W ($R=1/2$) cannot invade unless there is also haploid selection (see proof in \nameref{file:Mathematica}; Fig \ref{fig:SexAntagTighter} and \nameref{fig:SexAntagTighterMaleDrive}). 
%DIF > Of particularly importance, when selection is sexually-antagonistic in diploids ($s^\female s^\male <0$ and $0<h^\circ<1$), an unlinked neo-W ($R=1/2$) cannot invade unless there is also haploid selection (see proof in \nameref{file:Mathematica}; Fig \ref{fig:SexAntagTighter} and \nameref{fig:SexAntagTighterMaleDrive}). 
%More generally, haploid selection alters the conditions under which neo-W alleles can spread (compare \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive}-\nameref{fig:regionFemaleGS} to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots}). 
%
%%[SALLY:  I think that is enough, but we could add somewhere??: "Without haploid selection, unlinked neo-W alleles ($R=1/2$) can invade only under certain conditions, requiring either overdominance in males or underdominance in females (see proof in supplementary \textit{Mathematica} file).?  Note that underdominance in females with directional selection in males can lead to the spread of unlinked neo-W?s, but only from equilB (only $\Lambda_{ma}$ is greater than one in this case).]
%
%Male haploid selection in favour of the $a$ allele ($\alpha_{\Delta}^\male<0$, $w_{A}^\male<w_{a}^\male$) generates male-biased sex ratios at equilibria (A) and (B), where Y-$a$ is fixed ($\hat{p}_{Y}^\male=0$). 
%Male-biased sex ratios facilitate the spread of neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes (increasing $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$). 
%Panels A-C in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive} and \ref{fig:regionMaleGS} show that neo-W haplotypes tend to spread for a wider range of parameters when sex ratios are male biased, compared to Fig \ref{fig:regionplots} without haploid selection. 
%By contrast, male haploid selection in favour of the $A$ allele generates female-biased sex ratios and reduces $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$, as demonstrated by panels D-F in \nameref{fig:regionMaleDrive} and \nameref{fig:regionMaleGS}. 
%
%Female haploid selection generates direct selection on the neo-W-$A$ and neo-W-$a$ haplotypes as they spread in females. 
%Thus, female haploid selection in favour of the $a$ allele tends to increase $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$ and decrease $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$, as shown by panels A-C in \nameref{fig:regionFemaleDrive} and \nameref{fig:regionFemaleGS}. 
%Conversely, female haploid selection in favour of the $A$ allele increases $\Lambda_{W'A}^{(XY)}$ and decreases $\Lambda_{W'a}^{(XY)}$, see panels D-F in \nameref{fig:regionFemaleDrive} and \nameref{fig:regionFemaleGS}. 
%
%DIF < Thus, the impact of haploid selection on transitions between sex-determining systems must be considered as two sides of a coin: it can generate sex ratio biases that promote transitions that equalize the sex ratio, but it can also direct select for transitions that cause sex ratios to become biased.
